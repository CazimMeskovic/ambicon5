				and applicable national laws, which personal data (data for short) we as the controller – and the processors

				<br />
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">In short:</strong> We provide you with comprehensive information about
				any of your personal data we process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Privacy policies usually sound very technical and use legal terminology. However, this privacy policy is
				intended to describe the most important things to you as simply and transparently as possible. So long as it
				aids transparency, technical{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">terms are explained in a reader-friendly manner, links</strong> to
				further information are provided and <strong className="adsimple-112279866">graphics</strong> are used. We are
				thus informing in clear and simple language that we only process personal data in the context of our business
				activities if there is a legal basis for it. This is certainly not possible with brief, unclear and
				legal-technical statements, as is often standard on the internet when it comes to data protection. I hope you
				find the following explanations interesting and informative. Maybe you will also find some information that you
				have not been familiar with.
				<br />
				If you still have questions, we kindly ask you to contact the responsible body named below or in the imprint,

				Scope
			</h2>
			<p>
				This privacy policy applies to all personal data processed by our company and to all personal data processed by
				companies commissioned by us (processors). With the term personal data, we refer to information within the
				meaning of Article 4 No. 1 GDPR, such as the name, email address and postal address of a person. The processing
				of personal data ensures that we can offer and invoice our services and products, be it online or offline. The
				scope of this privacy policy includes:

			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">all online presences (websites, online shops) that we operate</li>

				<li className="adsimple-112279866">mobile apps for smartphones and other devices</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">In short:</strong> This privacy policy applies to all areas in which
				personal data is processed in a structured manner by the company via the channels mentioned. Should we enter
				into legal relations with you outside of these channels, we will inform you separately if necessary.

				Legal bases
			</h2>
			<p>
				In the following privacy policy, we provide you with transparent information on the legal principles and
				regulations, i.e. the legal bases of the General Data Protection Regulation, which enable us to process personal
				data.
				<br />
				Whenever EU law is concerned, we refer to REGULATION (EU) 2016/679 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL
				of April 27, 2016. You can of course access the General Data Protection Regulation of the EU online at EUR-Lex,
				the gateway to EU law, at{" "}

				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR): You have given us

				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Legal obligation</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. c GDPR): If we
					are subject to a legal obligation, we will process your data. For example, we are legally required to keep
					invoices for our bookkeeping. These usually contain personal data.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Legitimate interests</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. f GDPR): In
					the case of legitimate interests that do not restrict your basic rights, we reserve the right to process

					securely and economically. Therefore, the processing is a legitimate interest.
				</li>

			<p>
				Other conditions such as making recordings in the interest of the public, the exercise of official authority as
				well as the protection of vital interests do not usually occur with us. Should such a legal basis be relevant,

				Data transfer to third countries
			</h2>
			<p>
				We only transfer or process data to countries outside the scope of the GDPR (third countries) if you consent to
				this processing or if there is another legal permission. This is particularly true when processing is legally
				required or necessary for the performance of a contractual relationship, and in any case, only to the extent
				permitted by law. Your consent is in most cases the primary reason for us to process data in third countries.
				Processing of personal data in third countries such as the USA, where many software providers offer services and
				have their server locations, may mean that personal data is processed and stored in unexpected ways.
			</p>
			<p>
				We explicitly point out that, according to the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently only
				an adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA if a US company processing personal data of EU
				citizens in the USA is an active participant in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework. More information can be found
				at:{" "}
				<a
					className="adsimple-112279866"

				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Data processing by US services that are not active participants in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework may result
				in data not being anonymized and processed, if applicable. Additionally, US government authorities may
				potentially have access to individual data. Furthermore, it may occur that collected data is linked with data
				from other services of the same provider, if you have a corresponding user account. Where possible, we try to
				use server locations within the EU, if offered.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will inform you in the appropriate sections of this privacy policy in more detail about data transfers to
				third countries, if applicable.
			</p>
			<h2 id="sicherheit-datenverarbeitung-en" className="adsimple-112279866">
				Security of data processing operations
			</h2>
			<p>
				In order to protect personal data, we have implemented both technical and organisational measures. We encrypt or
				pseudonymise personal data wherever this is possible. Thus, we make it as difficult as we can for third parties
				to extract personal information from our data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Article 25 of the GDPR refers to “data protection by technical design and by data protection-friendly default”
				which means that both software (e.g. forms) and hardware (e.g. access to server rooms) appropriate safeguards
				and security measures shall always be placed. If applicable, we will outline the specific measures below.
			</p>
			<h2 id="tls-verschluesselung-https-en" className="adsimple-112279866">
				TLS encryption with https
			</h2>
			<p>
				The terms TLS, encryption and https sound very technical, which they are indeed. We use HTTPS (Hypertext
				Transfer Protocol Secure) to securely transfer data on the Internet.
				<br />
				This means that the entire transmission of all data from your browser to our web server is secured &#8211;
				nobody can &#8220;listen in&#8221;.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have thus introduced an additional layer of security and meet privacy requirements through technology design{" "}

					Article 25 Section 1 GDPR
				</a>
				). With the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security), which is an encryption protocol for safe data transfer on the
				internet, we can ensure the protection of confidential information.
				<br />
				You can recognise the use of this safeguarding tool by the little lock-symbol{" "}

				then act as processors with whom we conclude a contract, the so-called Data Processing Agreement (DPA). Most
				importantly for you to know is that any processing of your personal data takes place exclusively according to
				our instructions and must be regulated by the DPA.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Who are the processors?</h3>
			<p>
				As a company and website owner, we are responsible for any of your data that is processed by us. In addition to
				the controller, there may also be so-called processors involved. This includes any company or person who
				processes your personal data. More precisely and according to the GDPR&#8217;s definition, this means: Any
				natural or legal person, authority, institution or other entity that processes your personal data is considered
				a processor. Processors can therefore be service providers such as hosting or cloud providers, payment or
				newsletter providers or large companies such as Google or Microsoft.
			</p>
			<p>To make the terminology easier to comprehend, here is an overview of the GDPR&#8217;s three roles:</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Data subject</strong> (you as a customer or interested party) →{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Controller</strong> (we as a company and contracting entity) →{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Processors</strong> (service providers such as web hosts or cloud
				providers)
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Contents of a Data Processing Agreement</h3>
			<p>
				As mentioned above, we have concluded a DPA with our partners who act as processors. First and foremost, it
				states that the processor processes the data exclusively in accordance with the GDPR. The contract must be
				concluded in writing, although an electronic contract completion is also considered a “written contract”. Any
				processing of personal data only takes place after this contract is concluded. The contract must contain the
				following:
			</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">indication to us as the controller</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">obligations and rights of the controller</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">categories of data subjects</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">type of personal data</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">type and purpose of data processing</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">subject and duration of data processing</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">location of data processing</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Furthermore, the contract contains all obligations of the processor. The most important obligations are:</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">ensuring data security measures</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					taking possible technical and organisational measures to protect the rights of the data subject
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">maintaining a data processing record</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">cooperation with the data protection authority upon request</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">performing a risk analysis for any received personal data</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					subprocessors may only be appointed with the written consent of the controller
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What are cookies?</h3>
			<p>
				Our website uses HTTP-cookies to store user-specific data.
				<br />
				In the following we explain what cookies are and why they are used, so that you can better understand the
				following privacy policy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever you surf the Internet, you are using a browser. Common browsers are for example, Chrome, Safari,
				Firefox, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. Most websites store small text-files in your browser. These files
				are called cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is important to note that cookies are very useful little helpers. Almost every website uses cookies. More
				precisely, these are HTTP cookies, as there are also other cookies for other uses. HTTP cookies are small files
				that our website stores on your computer. These cookie files are automatically placed into the cookie-folder,
				which is the “brain” of your browser. A cookie consists of a name and a value. Moreover, to define a cookie, one
				or multiple attributes must be specified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cookies store certain user data about you, such as language or personal page settings. When you re-open our
				website to visit again, your browser submits these “user-related” information back to our site. Thanks to
				cookies, our website knows who you are and offers you the settings you are familiar to. In some browsers, each
				cookie has its own file, while in others, such as Firefox, all cookies are stored in one single file.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following graphic shows a possible interaction between a web browser such as Chrome and the web server. The
				web browser requests a website and receives a cookie back from the server. The browser then uses this again as
				soon as another page is requested.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img

					alt="HTTP cookie interaction between browser and web server"
					width="100%"
				/>
			</p>
			<p>
				There are both first-party cookies and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are created directly by our
				site, while third-party cookies are created by partner-websites (e.g. Google Analytics). Each cookie must be
				evaluated individually, as each cookie stores different data. The expiry time of a cookie also varies from a few
				minutes to a few years. Cookies are not software programs and do not contain viruses, trojans or other malware.
				Cookies also cannot access your PC’s information.
			</p>
			<p>This is an example of how cookie-files can look:</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Name:</strong> _ga
				<br />
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Value:</strong> GA1.2.1326744211.152112279866-9

				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Purpose:</strong> Differentiation between website visitors
				<br />
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Expiry date:</strong> after 2 years
			</p>
			<p>A browser should support these minimum sizes:</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">At least 4096 bytes per cookie</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">At least 50 cookies per domain</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">At least 3000 cookies in total</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which types of cookies are there?</h3>
			<p>
				The exact cookies that we use, depend on the used services, which will be outlined in the following sections of
				this privacy policy. Firstly, we will briefly focus on the different types of HTTP-cookies.
			</p>
			<p>There are 4 different types of cookies:</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">
					{" "}
					Essential cookies
					<br />
				</strong>{" "}
				These cookies are necessary to ensure the basic functions of a website. They are needed when a user for example
				puts a product into their shopping cart, then continues surfing on different websites and comes back later in
				order to proceed to the checkout. These cookies ensure the shopping cart does not get deleted, even if the user
				closes their browser window.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">
					{" "}
					Purposive cookies
					<br />
				</strong>{" "}
				These cookies collect information about user behaviour and whether the user receives any error messages.
				Furthermore, these cookies record the website’s loading time as well as its behaviour in different browsers.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">
					{" "}
					Target-orientated cookies
					<br />
				</strong>{" "}
				These cookies ensure better user-friendliness. Thus, information such as previously entered locations, fonts
				sizes or data in forms stay stored.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">
					{" "}
					Advertising cookies
					<br />
				</strong>
				These cookies are also known as targeting cookies. They serve the purpose of delivering customised
				advertisements to the user. This can be very practical, but also rather annoying.
			</p>
			<p>
				Upon your first visit to a website you are usually asked which of these cookie-types you want to accept.
				Furthermore, this decision will of course also be stored in a cookie.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to learn more about cookies and do not mind technical documentation, we recommend{" "}

				, the Request for Comments of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) called &#8220;HTTP State Management
				Mechanism&#8221;.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Purpose of processing via cookies</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose ultimately depends on the respective cookie. You can find out more details below or from the
				software manufacturer that sets the cookie.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				Cookies are little helpers for a wide variety of tasks. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell which data is
				generally stored in cookies, but in the privacy policy below we will inform you on what data is processed or
				stored.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Storage period of cookies</h3>
			<p>
				The storage period depends on the respective cookie and is further specified below. Some cookies are erased
				after less than an hour, while others can remain on a computer for several years.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can also influence the storage duration yourself. You can manually erase all cookies at any time in your
				browser (also see “Right of objection” below). Furthermore, the latest instance cookies based on consent will be
				erased is after you withdraw your consent. The legality of storage will remain unaffected until then.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Right of objection &#8211; how can I erase cookies?</h3>
			<p>
				You can decide for yourself how and whether you want to use cookies. Regardless of which service or website the
				cookies originate from, you always have the option of erasing, deactivating or only partially accepting cookies.
				You can for example block third-party cookies but allow all other cookies.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to find out which cookies have been stored in your browser, or if you want to change or erase cookie
				settings, you can find this option in your browser settings:

			<p>
				If you generally do not want cookies, you can set up your browser in a way to notify you whenever a cookie is
				about to be set. This gives you the opportunity to manually decide to either permit or deny the placement of
				every single cookie. This procedure varies depending on the browser. Therefore, it might be best for you to
				search for the instructions in Google. If you are using Chrome, you could for example put the search term
				“delete cookies Chrome” or “deactivate cookies Chrome” into Google.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal basis</h3>
			<p>
				The so-called “cookie directive” has existed since 2009. It states that the storage of cookies requires your{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">consent</strong> (Article 6 Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR). Within countries of
				the EU, however, the reactions to these guidelines still vary greatly. In Austria, however, this directive was
				implemented in Section 165 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (2021). In Germany, the cookie guidelines have not
				been implemented as national law. Instead, this guideline was largely implemented in Section 15 (3) of the
				Telemedia Act (TMG).
			</p>
			<p>
				For absolutely necessary cookies, even if no consent has been given, there are legitimate interests (Article 6
				(1) (f) GDPR), which in most cases are of an economic nature. We want to offer our visitors a pleasant user
				experience on our website. For this, certain cookies often are absolutely necessary.
			</p>
			<p>
				This is exclusively done with your consent, unless absolutely necessary cookies are used. The legal basis for
				this is Article 6 (1) (a) of the GDPR.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the following sections you will find more detail on the use of cookies, provided the used software does use
				cookies.

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is web hosting?</h3>
			<p>
				Every time you visit a website nowadays, certain information &#8211; including personal data &#8211; is
				automatically created and stored, including on this website. This data should be processed as sparingly as
				possible, and only with good reason. By website, we mean the entirety of all websites on your domain, i.e.
				everything from the homepage to the very last subpage (like this one here). By domain we mean example.uk or
				examplepage.com.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you want to view a website on a screen, you use a program called a web browser. You probably know the names
				of some web browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari.
			</p>
			<p>
				The web browser has to connect to another computer which stores the website&#8217;s code: the web server.
				Operating a web server is complicated and time-consuming, which is why this is usually done by professional
				providers. They offer web hosting and thus ensure the reliable and flawless storage of website data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whenever the browser on your computer establishes a connection (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and whenever data
				is being transferred to and from the web server, personal data may be processed. After all, your computer stores
				data, and the web server also has to retain the data for a period of time in order to ensure it can operate
				properly.

				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				Even while you are visiting our website, our web server, that is the computer on which this website is saved,
				usually automatically saves data such as
			</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is Web Analytics?</h3>
			<p>
				We use software on our website, which is known as web analytics, in order to evaluate website visitor behaviour.
				Thus, data is collected, which the analytic tool provider (also called tracking tool) stores, manages and
				processes. Analyses of user behaviour on our website are created with this data, which we as the website
				operator receive. Most tools also offer various testing options. These enable us, to for example test which
				offers or content our visitors prefer. For this, we may show you two different offers for a limited period of
				time. After the test (a so-called A/B test) we know which product or content our website visitors find more
				interesting. For such testing as well as for various other analyses, user profiles are created and the
				respective data is stored in cookies.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we run Web Analytics?</h3>
			<p>
				We have a clear goal in mind when it comes to our website: we want to offer our industry’s best website on the
				market. Therefore, we want to give you both, the best and most interesting offer as well as comfort when you
				visit our website. With web analysis tools, we can observe the behaviour of our website visitors, and then
				improve our website accordingly for you and for us. For example, we can see the average age of our visitors,
				where they come from, the times our website gets visited the most, and which content or products are
				particularly popular. All this information helps us to optimise our website and adapt it to your needs,
				interests and wishes.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				The exact data that is stored depends on the analysis tools that are being used. But generally, data such as the
				content you view on our website are stored, as well as e. g. which buttons or links you click, when you open a
				page, which browser you use, which device (PC, tablet, smartphone, etc.) you visit the website with, or which
				computer system you use. If you have agreed that location data may also be collected, this data may also be
				processed by the provider of the web analysis tool.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, your IP address is also stored. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), IP
				addresses are personal data. However, your IP address is usually stored in a pseudonymised form (i.e. in an
				unrecognisable and abbreviated form). No directly linkable data such as your name, age, address or email address
				are stored for testing purposes, web analyses and web optimisations. If this data is collected, it is retained
				in a pseudonymised form. Therefore, it cannot be used to identify you as a person.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following example shows Google Analytics’ functionality as an example for client-based web tracking with
				JavaScript code.

					alt="Schematic data flow in Google Analytics"
					width="100%"
				/>
			</p>
			<p>
				The storage period of the respective data always depends on the provider. Some cookies only retain data for a
				few minutes or until you leave the website, while other cookies can store data for several years.

				</span>
			</h3>
			<p>
				If we have any further information on the duration of data processing, you will find it below. We generally only
				process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide products and services. The storage
				period may be extended if it is required by law, such as for accounting purposes for example for accounting.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Right to object</h3>
			<p>
				You also have the option and the right to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers at
				any time. This works either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out functions. For example, you can
				also prevent data processing by cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing cookies in your browser.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal basis</h3>
			<p>
				The use of Web Analytics requires your consent, which we obtained with our cookie popup. According to{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a of the GDPR (consent)</strong>, this consent
				represents the legal basis for the processing of personal data, such as by collection through Web Analytics
				tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition to consent, we have a legitimate interest in analysing the behaviour of website visitors, which
				enables us to technically and economically improve our offer. With Web Analytics, we can recognise website
				errors, identify attacks and improve profitability. The legal basis for this is{" "}

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is Google Analytics?</h3>
			<p>
				On our website, we use the analytics tracking tool Google Analytics in the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) version
				provided by the American company Google Inc. For the European region, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House,
				Barrow Street Dublin 4, Ireland) is responsible for all Google services. Google Analytics collects data about
				your actions on our website. By combining various technologies such as cookies, device IDs, and login
				information, you can be identified as a user across different devices. This allows your actions to be analyzed
				across platforms as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, when you click on a link, this event is stored in a cookie and sent to Google Analytics. With the
				reports we receive from Google Analytics, we can better tailor our website and service to your needs. In the
				following, we will provide more information about the tracking tool and specifically inform you about the data
				processed and how you can prevent it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Google Analytics is a tracking tool used for website traffic analysis. The basis for these measurements and
				analyses is a pseudonymous user identification number. This number does not include personally identifiable
				information such as name or address but is used to assign events to a device. GA4 utilizes an event-based model
				that captures detailed information about user interactions such as page views, clicks, scrolling, and conversion
				events. Additionally, GA4 incorporates various machine learning features to better understand user behavior and
				certain trends. GA4 employs modeling through machine learning capabilities, meaning that based on the collected
				data, missing data can be extrapolated to optimize the analysis and provide forecasts.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order for Google Analytics to function properly, a tracking code is embedded in the code of our website. When
				you visit our website, this code records various events that you perform on our website. With GA4&#8217;s
				event-based data model, we, as website operators, can define and track specific events to obtain analyses of
				user interactions. This allows us to track not only general information such as clicks or page views but also
				specific events that are important for our business, such as submitting a contact form or making a purchase.
			</p>
			<p>Once you leave our website, this data is sent to and stored on Google Analytics servers.</p>
			<p>
				Google processes the data, and we receive reports on your user behavior. These reports can include, among
				others, the following:
			</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Audience reports: Audience reports help us get to know our users better and gain a more precise understanding
					of who is interested in our service.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Advertising reports: Advertising reports make it easier for us to analyze and improve our online advertising.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Acquisition reports: Acquisition reports provide helpful information on how we can attract more people to our
					service.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Behavior reports: Here, we learn about how you interact with our website. We can track the path you take on
					our site and which links you click on.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Conversion reports: Conversion refers to an action you take as a result of a marketing message, such as going
					from being a website visitor to becoming a buyer or newsletter subscriber. Through these reports, we gain
					insights into how our marketing efforts resonate with you, with the aim of improving our conversion rate.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Real-time reports: With real-time reports, we can see what is currently happening on our website. For example,
					we can see how many users are currently reading this text.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In addition to the above-mentioned analysis reports, Google Analytics 4 also offers the following functions:
			</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">

				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Advanced analytics features: With these features, we can gain a better understanding of your behavior on our
					website or certain general trends. For example, we can segment user groups, conduct comparative analyses of
					target audiences, or track your path on our website.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Predictive modeling: Based on the collected data, missing data can be extrapolated through machine learning to
					predict future events and trends. This can help us develop better marketing strategies.
				</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">
					Cross-platform analysis: Data collection and analysis are possible from both websites and apps. This enables
					us to analyze user behavior across platforms, provided you have consented to data processing.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use Google Analytics on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				Our goal with this website is clear: we want to provide you with the best possible service. The statistics and
				data from Google Analytics help us achieve this goal.
			</p>
			<p>
				The statistically evaluated data gives us a clear picture of the strengths and weaknesses of our website. On one
				hand, we can optimize our site to make it more easily found by interested people on Google. On the other hand,
				the data helps us better understand you as a visitor. We know exactly what we need to improve on our website in
				order to provide you with the best possible service. The data also helps us conduct our advertising and
				marketing activities in a more personalized and cost-effective manner. After all, it only makes sense to show
				our products and services to people who are interested in them.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data is stored by Google Analytics?</h3>
			<p>
				With the help of a tracking code, Google Analytics creates a random, unique ID associated with your browser
				cookie. This way, Google Analytics recognizes you as a new user, and a user ID is assigned to you. When you
				visit our site again, you are recognized as a &#8220;returning&#8221; user. All collected data is stored
				together with this user ID, making it possible to evaluate pseudonymous user profiles.
			</p>
			<p>
				To analyze our website with Google Analytics, a property ID must be inserted into the tracking code. The data is
				then stored in the corresponding property. For each newly created property, the default is Google Analytics 4
				Property. The data storage duration varies depending on the property used.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through identifiers such as cookies, app instance IDs, user IDs, or custom event parameters, your interactions,
				if you have consented, are measured across platforms. Interactions encompass all types of actions you perform on
				our website. If you also use other Google systems (such as a Google account), data generated through Google
				Analytics can be linked to third-party cookies. Google does not disclose Google Analytics data unless we, as
				website operators, authorize it, except when required by law.
			</p>
			<p>
				According to Google, IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google Analytics 4. However, IP address data is
				used by Google for deriving location data and is immediately deleted thereafter. All IP addresses collected from
				users in the EU are deleted before the data is stored in a data center or on a server.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since GA4 focuses on event-based data, the tool uses significantly fewer cookies compared to previous versions
				such as Google Universal Analytics. However, there are still some specific cookies used by GA4. These can
				include:
			</p>
			<p>
				Name: _ga
				<br />
				Value: 2.1326744211.152112279866-5
				<br />
				Purpose: By default, analytics.js uses the _ga cookie to store the user ID. It is used to distinguish website
				visitors.
				<br />
				Expiration: After 2 years
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Name:</strong> _gid

				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Purpose:</strong> This cookie is also used to distinguish website
				visitors.
				<br />
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Expiration:</strong> After 24 hours

			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Name:</strong> gat_gtag_UA Value: 1<br />
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Purpose:</strong> Used to reduce the request rate. If Google Analytics is
				deployed via Google Tag Manager, this cookie will be named dc_gtm .<br />
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Expiration:</strong> After 1 minute
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Note:</strong> This list cannot claim to be exhaustive, as Google may
				change their choice of cookies from time to time. GA4 aims to improve data privacy and offers several options
				for controlling data collection. For example, we can determine the storage duration ourselves and control data.
			</p>
			<p>Here we provide an overview of the main types of data collected by Google Analytics:</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Heatmaps:</strong> Google creates heatmaps to show the exact areas you
				click on. This provides us with information about your interactions on our site.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Session Duration:</strong> Google refers to session duration as the time
				you spend on our site without leaving. If you are inactive for 20 minutes, the session automatically ends.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Bounce Rate:</strong> Bounce rate refers to when you view only one page
				on our website and then leave.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Account Creation:</strong> If you create an account or place an order on
				our website, Google Analytics collects this data.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Location:</strong> IP addresses are not logged or stored in Google
				Analytics. However, location data is derived shortly before the IP address is deleted.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Technical Information:</strong> Technical information includes your
				browser type, internet service provider, and screen resolution, among others.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Source of Origin:</strong> Google Analytics is interested in the website
				or advertisement that brought you to our site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additional data may include contact information, reviews, media playback (e.g., if you play a video on our
				site), sharing of content via social media, or adding to favorites. This list is not exhaustive and serves only
				as a general guide to the data storage by Google Analytics.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Where and how long are the data stored?</h3>
			<p>
				Google has servers distributed worldwide. You can find precise information about the locations of Google data
				centers at:{" "}
				<a
					className="adsimple-112279866"
					href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en"
					target="_blank"
					rel="follow noopener noreferrer"
				>
					https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/?hl=en
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Your data is distributed across multiple physical storage devices. This ensures faster access to data and better
				protection against manipulation. Each Google data center has emergency programs in place for your data. In the
				event of hardware failure or natural disasters, the risk of service interruption at Google remains low.
			</p>
			<p>
				The retention period of data depends on the properties used. The storage duration is always set separately for
				each individual property. Google Analytics offers us four options for controlling the storage duration:
			</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">2 months: This is the shortest storage period.</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">14 months: By default, data is stored in GA4 for 14 months.</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">26 months: Data can also be stored for 26 months.</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Data is only deleted manually.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In addition, there is also the option for data to be deleted only if you do not visit our website within the
				selected time period. In this case, the retention period is reset every time you revisit our website within the
				defined time frame.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once the defined period has expired, the data is deleted once a month. This retention period applies to data
				linked to cookies, user identification, and advertising IDs (e.g., cookies from the DoubleClick domain). Report
				results are based on aggregated data and are stored independently of user data. Aggregated data is a combination
				of individual data into larger units.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
			<p>
				Under the data protection laws of the European Union, you have the right to access, update, delete, or restrict
				your data. By using the browser add-on to deactivate Google Analytics JavaScript (analytics.js, gtag.js), you
				can prevent Google Analytics 4 from using your data. You can download and install the browser add-on at:{" "}
				<a
					className="adsimple-112279866"
					href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en"
					target="_blank"
					rel="follow noopener noreferrer"

					https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en
				</a>{" "}
				Please note that this add-on only disables data collection by Google Analytics.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to disable, delete, or manage cookies in general, you can find the respective instructions for the
				most common browsers in the &#8220;Cookies&#8221; section.

				We also use the e-commerce measurement function of the web analysis tool Google Analytics for our website. This
				allows us to analyse very precisely how you and all our other customers interact with our website. E-commerce
				measurement is all about purchasing behaviour. Based on the data obtained, we can adapt and optimise our service
				to your wishes and expectations. With this data we can also use our online advertising measures in a more
				targeted manner, to only show our advertising to people who are interested in our products or services. The
				e-commerce measurement function records e. g. which orders were placed, how much time you took to decide on
				purchasing a product, the average order value or the shipping costs. All this data can be recorded and stored
				under a specific ID.

			<h2 id="google-analytics-google-signale-datenschutzerklaerung-en" className="adsimple-112279866">
				Google Analytics Google Signals Privacy Policy
			</h2>
			<p>
				We have activated Google signals in Google Analytics. Through this, any existing Google Analytics functions
				(advertising reports, remarketing, cross-device reports and reports on interests and demographic
				characteristics) are updated, to result in the summary and anonymisation of your data, should you have permitted
				personalised ads in your Google Account.
			</p>
			<p>
				The special aspect of this is that it involves cross-device tracking. That means your data can be analysed
				across multiple devices. Through the activation of Google signals, data is collected and linked to the Google
				account. For example, it enables Google to recognise when you look at a product on a smartphone and later buy
				the product on a laptop. Due to activating Google signals, we can start cross-device remarketing campaigns,
				which would otherwise not be possible to this extent. Remarketing means, that we can show you our products and
				services across other websites as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, further visitor data such as location, search history, YouTube history and data about your actions on
				our website are collected in Google Analytics. As a result, we receive improved advertising reports and more
				useful information on your interests and demographic characteristics. These include your age, the language you
				speak, where you live or what your gender is. Certain social criteria such as your job, your marital status or
				your income are also included. All these characteristics help Google Analytics to define groups of persons or
				target audiences.
			</p>
			<p>
				Those reports also help us to better assess your behaviour, as well as your wishes and interests. As a result,
				we can optimise and customise our products and services for you. By default, this data expires after 26 months.
				Please consider, that this data is only collected if you have agreed to personalised advertisement in your
				Google Account. The retained information is always exclusively summarised and anonymous data, and never any data
				on individual persons. You can manage or delete this data in your Google Account.

				Google Analytics in Consent Mode

				Depending on your consent, Google Analytics will progress your personal data in the so-called &#8220;consent
				mode&#8221;. You can choose whether or not you want to accept Google Analytics cookies, and thus which of your
				data Google Analytics may process. The retained data is mainly used to measure user behaviour on the website, to
				serve targeted advertising and to provide us with web analysis reports. Usually, you would consent to
				Google&#8217;s data processing via a cookie consent tool. If you do not consent to data processing, only
				aggregated data will be collected and processed. This means that data cannot be assigned to individual users and
				therefore no user profile will be created for you. You also have the option to only agree to statistical
				measurement, meaning that none of your personal data will be processed and used for advertising or advertising
				measurement sequences.

				information specifically related to GA: Cookies are used to store helpful data for GA in your device&#8217;s

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is Email-Marketing?</h3>
			<p>
				We use email marketing to keep you up to date. If you have agreed to receive our emails or newsletters, your
				data will be processed and stored. Email marketing is a part of online marketing. In this type of marketing,
				news or general information about a company, product or service are emailed to a specific group of people who
				are interested in it.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to participate in our email marketing (usually via newsletter), you usually just have to register
				with your email address. To do this, you have to fill in and submit an online form. However, we may also ask you
				for your title and name, so we can address you personally in our emails.
			</p>
			<p>
				The registration for newsletters generally works with the help of the so-called &#8220;double opt-in
				procedure&#8221;. After you have registered for our newsletter on our website, you will receive an email, via
				which you can confirm the newsletter registration. This ensures that you own the email address you signed up
				with, and prevents anyone to register with a third-party email address. We or a notification tool we use, will
				log every single registration. This is necessary so we can ensure and prove, that registration processes are
				done legally and correctly. In general, the time of registration and registration confirmation are stored, as
				well as your IP address. Moreover, any change you make to your data that we have on file is also logged.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use Email-Marketing?</h3>
			<p>
				Of course, we want to stay in contact with you and keep you in the loop of the most important news about our
				company. For this, we use email marketing &#8211; often just referred to as &#8220;newsletters&#8221; &#8211; as
				an essential part of our online marketing. If you agree to this or if it is permitted by law, we will send you
				newsletters, system emails or other notifications via email. Whenever the term “newsletter” is used in the
				following text, it mainly refers to emails that are sent regularly. We of course don&#8217;t want to bother you
				with our newsletter in any way. Thus, we genuinely strive to offer only relevant and interesting content. In our
				emails you can e.g. find out more about our company and our services or products. Since we are continuously
				improving our offer, our newsletter will always give you the latest news, or special, lucrative promotions.
				Should we commission a service provider for our email marketing, who offers a professional mailing tool, we do
				this in order to offer you fast and secure newsletters. The purpose of our email marketing is to inform you
				about new offers and also to get closer to our business goals.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				If you subscribe to our newsletter via our website, you then have to confirm your membership in our email list
				via an email that we will send to you. In addition to your IP and email address, your name, address and
				telephone number may also be stored. However, this will only be done if you agree to this data retention. Any
				data marked as such are necessary so you can participate in the offered service. Giving this information is
				voluntary, but failure to provide it will prevent you from using this service. Moreover, information about your
				device or the type of content you prefer on our website may also be stored. In the section &#8220;Automatic data
				storage&#8221; you can find out more about how your data is stored when you visit a website. We record your
				informed consent, so we can always prove that it complies with our laws.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Duration of data processing</h3>
			<p>
				If you unsubscribe from our e-mail/newsletter distribution list, we may store your address for up to three years
				on the basis of our legitimate interests, so we can keep proof your consent at the time. We are only allowed to
				process this data if we have to defend ourselves against any claims.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, if you confirm that you have given us your consent to subscribe to the newsletter, you can submit an
				individual request for erasure at any time. Furthermore, if you permanently object to your consent, we reserve
				the right to store your email address in a blacklist. But as long as you have voluntarily subscribed to our
				newsletter, we will of course keep your email address on file.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Withdrawal &#8211; how can I cancel my subscription?</h3>
			<p>
				You have the option to cancel your newsletter subscription at any time. All you have to do is revoke your
				consent to the newsletter subscription. This usually only takes a few seconds or a few clicks. Most of the time
				you will find a link at the end of every email, via which you will be able to cancel the subscription. Should
				you not be able to find the link in the newsletter, you can contact us by email and we will immediately cancel
				your newsletter subscription for you.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal basis</h3>
			<p>
				Our newsletter is sent on the basis of your <strong className="adsimple-112279866"> consent </strong> (Article 6
				(1) (a) GDPR). This means that we are only allowed to send you a newsletter if you have actively registered for
				it beforehand. Moreover, we may also send you advertising messages on the basis of Section 7 (3) UWG (Unfair
				Competition Act), provided you have become our customer and have not objected to the use of your email address
				for direct mail.
			</p>

				If available &#8211; you can find information on special email marketing services and how they process personal
				data, in the following sections.

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is MailChimp?</h3>
			<p>
				Like many other websites, we use the services of the newsletter company MailChimp on our website. The operator
				of MailChimp is the company Intuit Inc., 2700 Coast Ave, Mountain View, California 94043, USA. With the aid of
				MailChimp we can easily send you interesting news via newsletter. For the use of the service we do not have to
				install anything but can still access a pool of very efficient features. In the following we will give more
				details on this email marketing service and will inform you about the most important data protection aspects.
			</p>
			<p>
				MailChimp is a cloud-based newsletter management service. “Cloud-based“ means that we do not need to install
				MailChimp on our own computer or server. Instead, we use the service on an external server, or more specifically
				via an IT infrastructure, which is available via the internet. Using a software this way is also called SaaS
				(software as a service).
			</p>
			<p>
				<img
					decoding="async"
					role="img"
					src="https://www.adsimple.at/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mailchimp-overview-en.svg"
					alt="systematic funktion of mailchimp"
					width="100%"
				/>
			</p>
			<p>
				MailChimp allows us to chose from a wide range of different email types. Depending on what goal we want to reach
				with our newsletter, we can run individual campaigns, regular campaigns, auto responders (automated emails), A/B
				tests, RSS campaigns (mailings at pre-set times and frequencies) and follow-up campaigns.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use MailChimp on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				The reason we would use any newsletter service is so we can stay in contact with you. We want to keep you on the
				loop about what news or attractive offers we have for you at the time. As we constantly seek out the easiest and
				best solutions for our marketing measures, we have decided on MailChimp as our newsletter management service.
				While the software is very easy to use, it offers many helpful features. For example, it allows us to create
				interesting and attractive newsletters in only a short time. With integrated design templates we can create
				every newsletter in an individual way. Due to the “responsive design” feature, our contents are also presented
				in a readable and pleasant way on your smartphone (or any other mobile device).
			</p>
			<p>
				With tools such as A/B testing or the extensive analysis options, we can swiftly tell how you like our
				newsletters. This means that we can react if necessary and improve our offer or our services.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another advantage is MailChimp’s “cloud system”. The data is not stored and processed directly on our server. We
				can retrieve the data from external servers and therefore save our memory space and also decrease maintenance
				effort.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data is stored by MailChimp?</h3>
			<p>
				MailChimp operate online platforms which enable us to get in contact with you, provided you subscribed to our
				newsletter. If you become a subscriber of our newsletter via our website, by email you agree to become a member
				of a MailChimp email list. Then, MailChimp saves your subscription data and your IP address, so it can verify
				your entry into the list provider. Moreover, MailChimp stores your email address, your name, your physical
				address and demographic information, such as language or location.
			</p>
			<p>
				This information is used to send emails to you and to allow certain other MailChimp functions (e.g. the
				evaluation of newsletters).
			</p>
			<p>
				MailChimp also shares information with third parties to improve its services. Moreover, MailChimp shares certain
				data with advertising partners of third parties to get a better understanding of its clients’ interests, in
				order to provide relevant contents and target-oriented advertising.
			</p>
			<p>
				With so-called “web beacons” (small graphics in HTML emails), MailChimp can determine if an email has arrived,
				has been opened or if links have been clicked. This information is then stored on MailChimp’s servers. That way
				we receive statistical evaluations and can see how you liked our newsletter. Therefore, we can tailor our offer
				better to your wishes and improve our service.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, MailChimp are allowed to use this data for improving their own service. Thus, they can for example
				technically optimise the distribution or determine the location (or the country) of the recipient.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following cookies can be set by MailChimp. This list is not exhaustive and is merely an exemplary selection:

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How long and where is the data stored?</h3>
			<p>Since MailChimp is an American company, all retained data is stored on American servers.</p>
			<p>
				Generally, the data stays permanently stored on MailChimp’s servers and is deleted only when you request it. You
				can have your contact information with us deleted. This permanently removes all your personal data for us and
				anonymises you in MailChimp’s reports. However, you can also request the erasure of your data permanently at

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is Social Media?</h3>
			<p>
				In addition to our website, we are also active on various social media platforms. For us to be able to target
				interested users via social networks, user data may be processed. Additionally, elements of social media
				platforms may be embedded directly in our website. This is e.g. the case if you click a so-called social button
				on our website and are forwarded directly to our social media presence. So-called social media are websites and
				apps on which registered members can produce and exchange content with other members, be it openly or in certain
				groups and networks.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use Social Media?</h3>
			<p>
				For years, social media platforms have been the place where people communicate and get into contact online. With
				our social media presence, we can familiarise interested people better with our products and services. The
				social media elements integrated on our website help you switch to our social media content quickly and hassle
				free.
			</p>
			<p>
				The data that is retained and processed when you use a social media channel is primarily used to conduct web
				analyses. The aim of these analyses is to be able to develop more precise and personal marketing and advertising
				strategies. The evaluated data on your behaviour on any social media platform can help to draw appropriate
				conclusions about your interests. Moreover, so-called user profiles can be created. Thus, the platforms may also
				to present you with customised advertisements. For this, cookies are usually placed in your browser, which store
				data on your user behaviour.
			</p>
			<p>
				We generally assume that we will continue to be responsible under Data Protection Law, even when using the
				services of a social media platform. However, the European Court of Justice has ruled that, within the meaning
				of Art. 26 GDPR, in certain cases the operator of the social media platform can be jointly responsible with us.
				Should this be the case, we will point it out separately and work on the basis of a related agreement. You will
				then find the essence of the agreement for the concerned platform below.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that when you use social media platforms or our built-in elements, your data may also be processed
				outside the European Union, as many social media channels, such as Facebook or Twitter, are American companies.
				As a result, you may no longer be able to easily claim or enforce your rights regarding your personal data.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				Exactly which data are stored and processed depends on the respective provider of the social media platform. But
				usually it is data such as telephone numbers, email addresses, data you enter in contact forms, user data such
				as which buttons you click, what you like or who you follow, when you visited which pages, as well as
				information about your device and IP address. Most of this data is stored in cookies. Should you have a profile
				on the social media channel you are visiting and are logged in, data may be linked to your profile.
			</p>
			<p>
				All data that are collected via social media platforms are also stored on the providers&#8217; servers. This
				means that only the providers have access to the data and can provide you with appropriate information or make
				changes for you.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you want to know exactly which data is stored and processed by social media providers and how you can object
				to the data processing, we recommend you to carefully read the privacy policy of the respective company. We also
				recommend you to contact the provider directly if you have any questions about data storage and data processing
				or if you want to assert any corresponding rights.

				Provided we have any further information on this, we will inform you about the duration of the data processing

				company&#8217;s own purposes. However, customer data that is synchronised with your own user data is erased
				within two days. Generally, we only process personal data for as long as is absolutely necessary for the
				provision of our services and products. This storage period can also be exceeded however, if it is required by
				law, such as e.g. in the case of accounting.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Right to object</h3>
			<p>
				You also retain the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers
				such as embedded social media elements at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or
				via other opt-out functions. You can e.g. also prevent data collection via cookies by managing, deactivating or
				erasing cookies in your browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since cookies may be used with social media tools, we also recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies.
				If you want to find out which of your data is stored and processed, we advise you to read the privacy policies
				of the respective tools.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal basis</h3>

				If you have consented to the processing and storage of your data by integrated social media elements, this
				consent serves as the legal basis for data processing{" "}

				Facebook&#8217;s products. If you have any questions about Facebook&#8217;s data collection and processing, you
				can contact the company directly. Should you direct the question to us, we are obliged to forward it to
				Facebook.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the following we will give you an overview on the different Facebook tools, as well as on what data is sent
				to Facebook and how you can erase this data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Along with many other products, Facebook also offers so called “Facebook Business Tools”. This is Facebook’s
				official name for its tools, but it is not very common. Therefore, we decided to merely call them “Facebook
				tools”. They include the following:
			</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Facebook-Pixel</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Social Plugins (e.g. the “Like” or “Share“ button)</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Facebook Login</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Account Kit</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">APIs (application programming interface)</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">SDKs (Softwart developmept kits)</li>

				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Documentations</li>
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">Technologies and Services</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				With these tools Facebook can extend its services and is able to receive information on user activities outside
				of Facebook.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use Facebook tools on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				We only want to show our services and products to people who are genuinely interested in them. With the help of
				advertisements (Facebook Ads) we can reach exactly these people. However, to be able to show suitable adverts to
				users, Facebook requires additional information on people’s needs and wishes. Therefore, information on the user
				behaviour (and contact details) on our website, are provided to Facebook. Consequently, Facebook can collect
				better user data and is able to display suitable adverts for our products or services. Thanks to the tools it is
				possible to create targeted, customised ad campaigns of Facebook.
			</p>
			<p>
				Facebook calls data about your behaviour on our website “event data” and uses them for analytics services. That
				way, Facebook can create “campaign reports” about our ad campaigns’ effectiveness on our behalf. Moreover, by
				analyses we can get a better insight in how you use our services, our website or our products. Therefore, some
				of these tools help us optimise your user experience on our website. With the social plugins for instance, you
				can share our site’s contents directly on Facebook.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data is stored by Facebook tools?</h3>
			<p>
				With the use of Facebook tools, personal data (customer data) may be sent to Facebook. Depending on the tools
				used, customer data such as name, address, telephone number and IP address may be transmitted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Facebook uses this information to match the data with the data it has on you (if you are a Facebook member).
				However, before the customer data is transferred to Facebook, a so called “Hashing” takes place. This means,
				that a data record of any size is transformed into a string of characters, which also has the purpose of
				encrypting data.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, not only contact data, but also “event data“ is transferred. These data are the information we receive
				about you on our website. To give an example, it allows us to see what subpages you visit or what products you
				buy from us. Facebook does not disclose the obtained information to third parties (such as advertisers), unless
				the company has an explicit permission or is legally obliged to do so. Also, “event data“ can be linked to
				contact information, which helps Facebook to offer improved, customised adverts. Finally, after the previously
				mentioned matching process, Facebook deletes the contact data.
			</p>
			<p>
				To deliver optimised advertisements, Facebook only uses event data, if they have been combined with other data
				(that have been collected by Facebook in other ways). Facebook also uses event data for the purposes of
				security, protection, development and research. Many of these data are transmitted to Facebook via cookies.
				Cookies are little text files, that are used for storing data or information in browsers. Depending on the tools
				used, and on whether you are a Facebook member, a different number of cookies are placed in your browser. In the
				descriptions of the individual Facebook tools we will go into more detail on Facebook cookies. You can also find
				general information about the use of Facebook cookies at{" "}

			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
			<p>
				Facebook fundamentally stores data, until they are no longer of use for their own services and products.
				Facebook has servers for storing their data all around the world. However, customer data is cleared within 48
				hours after they have been matched with their own user data.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
			<p>
				In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) you have the right of information,
				rectification, transfer and deletion of your data.
			</p>
			<p>
				The collected data is only fully deleted, when you delete your entire Facebook account. Deleting your Facebook
				account works as follows:
			</p>
			<p>1) Click on settings in the top right side in Facebook.</p>
			<p>2) Then, click “Your Facebook information“ in the left column.</p>
			<p>3) Now click on “Deactivation and deletion”.</p>
			<p>4) Choose “Permanently delete account“ and then click on “Continue to account deletion“.</p>
			<p>5) Enter your password, click on “continue“ and then on “Delete account“.</p>
			<p>
				The retention of data Facebook receives via our site is done via cookies (e.g. with social plugins), among
				others. You can deactivate, clear or manage both all and individual cookies in your browser. How this can be
				done differs depending on the browser you use. The following instructions show, how to manage cookies in your

				Facebook Social Plugins Privacy Policy
			</h2>
			<p>
				We installed so-called social plugins from Facebook Inc. to our website. You can recognise these buttons by the
				classNameic Facebook logo, the &#8220;Like&#8221; button (hand with raised thumb) or by a &#8220;Facebook
				plugin&#8221; label. A social plugin is a small part of Facebook that is integrated into our page. Each plugin
				has its own function. The most used functions are the well-known &#8220;Like&#8221; and &#8220;Share&#8221;
				buttons.
			</p>
			<p>Facebook offers the following social plugins:</p>
			<ul className="adsimple-112279866">
				<li className="adsimple-112279866">&#8220;Save&#8221; button</li>

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is LinkedIn?</h3>
			<p>
				On our website we use social plugins from the social media network LinkedIn, of the LinkedIn Corporation, 2029
				Stierlin Court, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Social plugins can be feeds, content sharing or a link to our
				LinkedIn page. Social plugins are clearly marked with the well-known LinkedIn logo and for example allow sharing
				interesting content directly via our website. Moreover, LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company Wilton Place in
				Dublin is responsible for data processing in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
			</p>
			<p>
				By embedding these plugins, data can be sent to, as well as stored and processed by LinkedIn. In this privacy
				policy we want to inform you what data this is, how the network uses this data and how you can manage or prevent
				data retention.
			</p>
			<p>
				LinkedIn is the largest social network for business contacts. In contrast to e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn focuses
				exclusively on establishing business connections. Therefore, companies can present services and products on the
				platform and establish business relationships. Many people also use LinkedIn to find a job or to find suitable
				employees for their own company. In Germany alone, the network has over 11 million members. In Austria there are
				about 1.3 million.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use LinkedIn on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				We know how busy you are. You just cannot keep up with following every single social media channel. Even if it
				would really be worth it, as it is with our channels, since we keep posting interesting news and articles worth
				spreading. Therefore, on our website we have created the opportunity to share interesting content directly on
				LinkedIn, or to refer directly to our LinkedIn page. We consider built-in social plugins as an extended service
				on our website. The data LinkedIn collects also help us to display potential advertising measures only to people
				who are interested in our offer.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data are stored by LinkedIn?</h3>
			<p>
				LinkedIn stores no personal data due to the mere integration of social plugins. LinkedIn calls the data
				generated by plugins passive impressions. However, if you click on a social plugin to e.g. share our content,
				the platform stores personal data as so-called &#8220;active impressions&#8221;. This happens regardless of
				whether you have a LinkedIn account or not. If you are logged in, the collected data will be assigned to your
				account.
			</p>
			<p>
				When you interact with our plugins, your browser establishes a direct connection to LinkedIn’s servers. Through
				that, the company logs various usage data. These may include your IP address, login data, device information or
				information about your internet or cellular provider. If you use LinkedIn services via your smartphone, your
				location may also be identified (after you have given permission). Moreover, LinkedIn can share these data with
				third-party advertisers in “hashed” form. Hashing means that a data set is transformed into a character string.
				This allows data to be encrypted, which prevents persons from getting identified.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most data on of your user behaviour is stored in cookies. These are small text files that usually get placed in
				your browser. Furthermore, LinkedIn can also use web beacons, pixel tags, display tags and other device
				recognitions.
			</p>
			<p>
				Various tests also show which cookies are set when a user interacts with a social plug-in. We do not claim for
				the information we found to be exhaustive, as it only serves as an example. The following cookies were set
				without being logged in to LinkedIn:

			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
			<p>
				In general, LinkedIn retains your personal data for as long as the company considers it necessary for providing
				its services. However, LinkedIn deletes your personal data when you delete your account. In some exceptional
				cases, LinkedIn keeps some summarised and anonymised data, even account deletions. As soon as you delete your
				account, it may take up to a day until other people can no longer see your data. LinkedIn generally deletes the
				data within 30 days. However, LinkedIn retains data if it is necessary for legal reasons. Also, data that can no
				longer be assigned to any person remains stored even after the account is closed. The data are stored on various
				servers in America and presumably also in Europe.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How can I delete my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
			<p>
				You have the right to access and delete your personal data at any time. In your LinkedIn account you can manage,
				change and delete your data. Moreover, you can request a copy of your personal data from LinkedIn.
			</p>
			<p>How to access account data in your LinkedIn profile:</p>
			<p>
				In LinkedIn, click on your profile icon and select the &#8220;Settings &amp; Privacy&#8221; section. Now click
				on &#8220;Privacy&#8221; and then on the section &#8220;How LinkedIn uses your data on&#8221;. Then, click
				&#8220;Change&#8221; in the row with &#8220;Manage your data and activity&#8221;. There you can instantly view
				selected data on your web activity and your account history.
			</p>
			<p>
				In your browser you also have the option of preventing data processing by LinkedIn. As mentioned above, LinkedIn
				stores most data via cookies that are placed in your browser. You can manage, deactivate or delete these
				cookies. Depending on which browser you have, these settings work a little different. You can find the
				instructions for the most common browsers here:

				LinkedIn processes data from you, among other things, in the USA. LinkedIn is an active participant in the EU-US

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is Pinterest?</h3>
			<p>
				On our website we use buttons and widgets by the social media network Pinterest, of the company Pinterest Inc.,
				808 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For the European area, the entity responsible for all aspects
				of privacy is the Irish company Pinterest Europe Ltd. (Palmerston House, 2nd Floor, Fenian Street, Dublin 2,
				Ireland).
			</p>
			<p>
				Pinterest is a social network that specialises in graphic representations and photographs. Its name is made up
				of the two words &#8220;pin&#8221; and &#8220;interest&#8221;. Users can exchange ideas about various hobbies
				and interests via Pinterest and view profiles with pictures openly or in defined groups.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use Pinterest?</h3>
			<p>
				The social media platform Pinterest has been around for a few years now and is still one of the most visited and
				valued platforms. Pinterest is particularly suitable for our industry because the platform is primarily known
				for beautiful and interesting images. That is why we are of course also represented on Pinterest and want to put
				our content in the limelight in places other than our website. The collected data may also be used for
				advertising purposes, so we can show advertising messages to precisely those people who are interested in our
				services or products.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed by Pinterest?</h3>
			<p>
				Pinterest may store so-called log data. This includes information about your browser, IP address, our website
				address and the your activities on it (e.g. when you click the save or pin button), along with your search
				history, the date and time of the request as well as cookie and device data. If you interact with an embedded
				Pinterest function, cookies that store various data may also be set in your browser. Most of the above-mentioned
				log data, as well as preset language settings and clickstream data are stored in cookies. Pinterest considers
				clickstream data as information about your website behaviour.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have a Pinterest account yourself and are logged in, the data collected via our site may be linked to
				your account and used for advertising purposes. If you interact with our integrated Pinterest functions, you
				will usually be redirected to the Pinterest page. Below you will see an exemplary selection of cookies that can
				then be placed in your browser.

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How long and where are the data retained?</h3>
			<p>
				Pinterest basically stores the collected data until it is no longer needed for the company&#8217;s purposes. As
				soon as the storage of this data is no longer necessary, e.g. for the compliance with legal regulations, the
				data is either erased or anonymised so you can no longer be identified as a person. The data may also be stored
				on American servers.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Right to object</h3>
			<p>
				You also have the right and the option to revoke your consent to the use of cookies or third-party providers
				such as Pinterest at any time. This can be done either via our cookie management tool or via other opt-out
				functions. You can for example also prevent data retention by cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing
				cookies in your browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since cookies can be used with embedded Pinterest elements, we also recommend you to read our general privacy
				policy on cookies. To find out which of your data are stored and processed, you should read the privacy policies
				of the respective tools.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal basis</h3>
			<p>
				If you have consented to the processing and storage of you data by integrated social media elements, this
				consent is the legal basis for data processing{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866"> (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR)</strong>. Generally, your data is also
				stored and processed on the basis of our legitimate interest{" "}
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866"> (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR)</strong> in maintaining fast and good
				communication with you or other customers and business partners. Nevertheless, we only use the tool if you have
				given your consent to it. Most social media platforms also place cookies in your browser to store data. We
				therefore recommend you to read our privacy policy on cookies carefully and to take a look at the privacy policy
				or the cookie policy of the respective service provider.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pinterest also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the
				European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA.
				This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Pinterest uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as basis for data processing by
				recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and especially
				in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR). These clauses oblige Pinterest
				to comply with the EU‘s level of data protection when processing relevant data outside the EU. These clauses are
				based on an implementing order by the EU Commission. You can find the order and the clauses here:{" "}

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is X?</h3>
			<p>
				On our website, we have integrated features from X. These include embedded tweets, timelines, buttons, or
				hashtags, for example. X is a short messaging service and social media platform provided by the American company
				X Corp., located at 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For the European region,
				Twitter International Unlimited Company (One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07, Ireland) is
				responsible for processing personal data.
			</p>
			<p>
				To our knowledge, in the European Economic Area and Switzerland, a mere integration of the X function does not
				transfer any personal data or data about your web activities to X. Only when you interact with the X functions,
				such as by clicking a button, data could be sent to X and get saved as well as processed there. We have no
				influence on this processing of data and do not bare any responsibility for it. Within this privacy statement,
				we want to give you an overview of what data X stores, what X does with this data and how you can largely
				protect yourself from data transmission.
			</p>
			<p>
				For some, X is a news service, for others, a social media platform, and for others still it is a microblogging
				service. All these terms are justified and mean pretty much the same.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both individuals as well as companies use X for communicating with interested people via short messages. X only
				allows 280 characters per message. These messages are called &#8220;tweets&#8221;. In contrast to Facebook, for
				example, the service does not focus on the expansion of a network of &#8220;friends&#8221;, but strives to be
				regarded as an open, worldwide news platform. On X you can also have an anonymous account and tweets can be
				deleted by both, either the company or the users themselves.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use X on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				Like many other websites and companies, we try to use different channels for offering our services and
				communicating with our customers. X is a truly useful “small” news service, which is why it has grown dear to
				us. We regularly tweet or retweet exciting, funny or interesting content. We understand that you do not have the
				time to follow every channel after channel, as you surely have enough other things to do. That is why we also
				have integrated X functions to our website. That way, you can experience our X activities &#8220;on site&#8221;
				or come to our X page via a direct link. With the integration, we want to strengthen the service and
				user-friendliness on our website.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data is stored by X?</h3>
			<p>
				You will find integrated X functions on some of our subpages. If you interact with X content, such as by
				clicking a button, X may collect and save data. This can happen even if you don&#8217;t have a X account
				yourself. X calls this data &#8220;log data&#8221;. It includes demographic data, browser cookie IDs, your
				smartphone’s ID, hashed email addresses, and information on which pages you have visited on X and what actions
				you have taken there. Of course, X stores more data if you have a X account and are logged in. This retention is
				usually done via cookies. Cookies are small text files that are usually set in your browser and transmit various
				information to X.
			</p>
			<p>
				We will now show you which cookies are placed if you are not logged in to X but visit a website with built-in X
				functions. Please consider this list as an example. We do not claim for this list to be extensive, since the
				array of cookies always changes and depends on your individual actions with X content.

				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Note: </strong>X also works with third parties. Therefore, we have

			</p>
			<p>
				On the one hand, X uses the collected data for gaining better understand on user behaviour, and thus to improve
				their own services and advertising offers. On the other hand, the data are also used for internal security
				measures.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
			<p>
				When X collects data from other websites, after a maximum of 30 days, they will be deleted, summarised or
				otherwise concealed. X’s servers are in various server centres in the United States. Accordingly, it can be
				assumed that the gathered data will be collected and stored in America. In our research we could not clearly
				determine whether X also owns servers in Europe. Generally, X may keep collected data stored until either the
				data are no longer useful to the company, until you delete the data or until a potential legal deletion period
				has been reached.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
			<p>
				In their Privacy Policy, X repeatedly emphasise that they do not save data from external website visits,
				provided you or your browser are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. However, if you interact directly
				with X, the company will of course store your data.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have a X account, you can manage your data by clicking on &#8220;More&#8221; under the
				&#8220;Profile&#8221; button. Then click on &#8220;Settings and privacy&#8221;. Here you can manage data
				processing individually.

				If you do not have a X account, you can go to{" "}
				<a className="adsimple-112279866" href="https://twitter.com/">
					twitter.com
				</a>{" "}
				and click “Settings”. At “Personalisation and data” you can manage data that is collected on you.
			</p>
			<p>
				As mentioned above, most data are stored via cookies, which you can manage, deactivate or delete in your
				browser. Please note that when changing cookie settings in your browser, the edits will only affect that very
				browser. This means that if you use another browser in the future, you will have to manage your cookie settings

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is a payment provider?</h3>
			<p>
				On our website we use online payment systems, which enable us as well as you to have a secure and smooth payment
				process available. Among other things, personal data may also be sent to the respective payment provider, where
				it may also be stored and processed. Payment providers are online payment systems that enable you to place an
				order via online banking. The payment processing is carried out by the payment provider of your choice. We will
				then receive information about the payment. This method can be used by any user who has an active online banking
				account with a PIN and TAN. There are hardly any banks that do not offer or accept such payment methods.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use payment providers on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				With both our website and our embedded online shop, we of course want to offer you the best possible service, so
				you can feel comfortable on our site and take advantage of our offers. We know that your time is valuable and
				that payment processing in particular has to work quickly and smoothly. Thus, we offer various payment
				providers. You can choose your preferred payment provider and pay in the usual way.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				What exact data that is processed of course depends on the respective payment provider. However, generally data
				such as name, address, bank details (account number, credit card number, passwords, TANs, etc.) do get stored.
				This data is necessary for carrying out any transactions. In addition, any contract data and user data, such as
				when you have visited our website, what content you are interested in or which sub-pages you have clicked, may
				also be stored. Most payment providers also store your IP address and information about the computer you are
				using.
			</p>
			<p>
				Your data is usually stored and processed on the payment providers&#8217; servers. We, so the website operator,
				do not receive this data. We only get information on whether the payment has gone through or not. For identity
				and credit checks, it may happen for payment providers to forward data to the appropriate body. The business and
				privacy policy principles of the respective provider always apply to all payment transactions. Therefore, please
				always take a look at the general terms and conditions and the privacy policy of the payment provider. You e.g.
				also have the right to have data erased or rectified at any time. Please contact the respective service provider
				regarding your rights (right to withdraw, right of access and individual rights).

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is PayPal?</h3>
			<p>
				We use the online payment service PayPal on our website. The service provider is the American company PayPal
				Inc. For the European region, the responsible entity is PayPal Europe (S.à r.l. et Cie, S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard
				Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg).
				<br />
				With PayPal, all users can send and receive money electronically. The company was founded in 1998 and has since
				grown to become one of the most well-known and largest online payment service providers worldwide, boasting over
				325 million active customers.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use PayPal for our website?</h3>
			<p>
				There are various reasons why we use and offer PayPal on our website. As one of the most recognized online
				payment providers, many of our website visitors use and trust this service. PayPal also provides high-security
				standards for digital money transfers, utilizing various encryption methods to protect your personal data. We
				also appreciate the user-friendly interface of PayPal and the ability to make international payments in
				different currencies. Transactions typically proceed quickly, benefiting both us and you as customers.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data does PayPal process?</h3>
			<p>
				In its privacy policy, PayPal distinguishes various categories of personal data that may be processed through
				the use of the service. These include registration and contact details, identification and signature data,
				payment information, information about imported contacts, data from your account profile, device data such as
				your IP address, location data, and so-called derived data. Derived data includes information that can be
				derived from transactions or other data, such as purchasing habits, behavioral patterns, creditworthiness, or
				personal preferences.
				<br />
				Additionally, there are personal data collected by third parties (such as identity verification providers, fraud
				detection providers, or your bank). These data may include information from credit agencies, transaction data,
				information about legal regulations, technical usage data, location data, and derived data once again.
			</p>
			<p>
				PayPal and its partners also use tracking technologies like cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, and widgets to
				recognize you as a user, customize content, and conduct analyses for interest-based advertising.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How long and where are the data stored?</h3>
			<p>
				In general, PayPal retains data for as long as necessary to fulfill its obligations and within the scope of the
				purpose. Personal data necessary for the customer relationship is kept for up to 10 years after the relationship
				ends. If PayPal is subject to a legal obligation, the retention period for personal data complies with the
				applicable law (e.g., insolvency law). PayPal also stores personal data for as long as necessary if retention is
				advisable for legal disputes.
				<br />
				As PayPal is a globally operating company, the service has data centers worldwide where your data may be stored.
				This means your data may be stored outside your country and outside the scope of the GDPR on PayPal servers.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How can I delete my data or prevent data storage?</h3>
			<p>
				You have the right to access, correct, delete, and restrict the processing of your personal data at any time.
				You can also revoke your consent to data processing at any time.
				<br />
				If you want to disable, delete, or manage cookies in general, you can find the corresponding links to the
				instructions for the most popular browsers in the &#8220;Cookies&#8221; section.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal Basis</h3>
			<p>
				We have a legitimate interest in integrating PayPal as an external payment service to make our offer more
				attractive and improve it technically and economically. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR
				(Legitimate interests). Please note that you can only use PayPal if you enter into a contractual relationship
				with PayPal. In this case, it may be necessary to provide additional data protection and contractual
				declarations (e.g., consent).
				<br />
				PayPal processes data from you, among other places, in the USA. We would like to inform you that, according to
				the opinion of the European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for the
				transfer of data to the USA. This may entail various risks for the legality and security of data processing.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the basis for data processing for recipients based in third countries (outside the European Union, Iceland,
				Liechtenstein, Norway, especially in the USA) or data transfers to such countries, PayPal uses so-called
				Standard Contractual Clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 and 3 GDPR). Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) are model
				templates provided by the EU Commission and are intended to ensure that your data complies with European data
				protection standards even when transferred and stored in third countries (such as the USA). Through these
				clauses, PayPal undertakes to comply with the European data protection level in processing your relevant data,
				even if the data is stored, processed, and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an implementing
				decision of the EU Commission. You can find the decision and the corresponding Standard Contractual Clauses,
				among other things, here:{" "}

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is Stripe?</h3>
			<p>
				On our website we use a payment tool by Stripe, an American technology company and online payment service.
				Stripe Payments Europe (Europe Ltd., 1 Grand Canal Street Lower, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin, Ireland) is
				responsible for customers within the EU. Therefore, if you choose Stripe as your payment method, your payment
				will be processed via Stripe Payments. Hence, the data required for the payment process is forwarded to Stripe
				where it is then stored. In this privacy policy we will give you an overview of Stripe’s data processing and
				retention. Moreover, we will explain why we use Stripe on our website.
			</p>
			<p>
				The technology company Stripe offers payment solutions for online payments. Stripe enables us to accept credit
				and debit card payments in our webshop while it handles the entire payment process. A major advantage of Stripe
				is that you never have to leave our website or shop during the payment process. Moreover, payments are processed
				very quickly via Stripe.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use Stripe on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				We of course want to offer the best possible service with both our website and our integrated online shop. After
				all, we would like you to feel comfortable on our site and take advantage of our offers. We know that your time
				is valuable and therefore, payment processing in particular must work quickly and smoothly. In addition to our
				other payment providers, with Stripe we have found a partner that guarantees secure and fast payment processing.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What data are stored by Stripe?</h3>
			<p>
				If you choose Stripe as your payment method, your personal data (transaction data) will be transmitted to Stripe
				where it will be stored. These data include the payment method (i.e. credit card, debit card or account number),
				bank sort code, currency, as well as the amount and the payment date. During a transaction, your name, email
				address, billing or shipping address and sometimes your transaction history may also be transmitted. These data
				are necessary for authentication. Furthermore, Stripe may also collect relevant data for the purpose of fraud
				prevention, financial reporting and for providing its services in full. These data may include your name,
				address, telephone number as well as your country in addition to technical data about your device (such as your
				IP address).
			</p>
			<p>
				Stripe does not sell any of your data to independent third parties, such as marketing agencies or other
				companies that have nothing to do with Stripe. However, data may be forwarded to internal departments, a limited
				number of Stripe’s external partners or for legal compliance reasons. What is more, Stripe uses cookies to
				collect data. Here is a selection of cookies that Stripe may set during the payment process:

				Generally, personal data are stored for the duration of the provided service. This means that the data will be

				Stripe may also store personal data for longer than the duration of the provided service. Furthermore, since
				Stripe is a global company, your data may be stored in any of the countries Stripe offers its services in.
				Therefore, your data may be stored outside your country, such as in the USA for example.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">How can I erase my data or prevent data retention?</h3>
			<p>
				Please note that when you use this tool, your data may also be stored and processed outside the EU. Most third
				countries (including the USA) are not considered secure under current European data protection law. Data must
				not simply be transferred to, as well as stored and processed in insecure third countries, unless there are
				suitable guarantees (such as EU standard contractual clauses) between us and the respective non-European service
				provider.

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What are external online platforms?</h3>
			<p>
				In order to be able to offer our services or products outside of our website, we also use external platforms.
				These are mostly online marketplaces such as Amazon or eBay. In addition to our responsibility for data
				protection, the data privacy regulations of the external platforms used also apply. This especially applies when
				our products are purchased via such a platform, i. e. if there is a payment process. Furthermore, most platforms
				also use your data to optimise their own marketing measures. For example, the platform can use the collected
				data to tailor advertisements to the interests of customers and website visitors.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use external online platforms?</h3>
			<p>
				In addition to our website, we also want to display our offer on other platforms in order to reach more
				customers. External online marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay or Digistore24 offer large sales websites that show
				our products to people who may not know our website. Moreover, built-in elements on our site may also lead to an
				external online platform. Any data that is processed and stored by the respective online platform is used by the
				business to log the payment process and also to conduct web analyses.
			</p>
			<p>
				The aim of these analyses is to enable the development of more precise and personal marketing and advertising
				strategies. Depending on your interaction with a platform, the evaluated data may be used to draw appropriate
				conclusions about your interests and to create a so-called user profile on you. This also allows the platforms
				to show customised advertisements or products to you. For this purpose, cookies are usually set in your browser
				in order to store data on your usage behaviour.
			</p>
			<p>
				Please note that when using the platforms or our built-in elements, your data may also be processed outside the
				European Union, since online platforms such as Amazon or eBay are American companies. As a result, you may not
				be able to claim or enforce your rights in relation to your personal data as easily.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data is processed?</h3>
			<p>
				Exactly which data is stored and processed depends on the respective external platform. But usually, it is data
				such as phone numbers, email addresses, data you enter in a contact form, along with user data (e. g. which
				buttons you click and which pages you view during your visit), as well as information about your device and IP
				address. In most cases, the majority of this data is stored in cookies. If you have a profile on an external
				platform and are logged in there, your data can be linked to any such profile. The collected data is stored on
				the servers of the platforms used, where it is processed. You can find out exactly how an external platform
				stores, manages and processes data in the respective privacy policy. If you have any questions about data
				storage and data processing, or if you want to assert corresponding rights, we recommend that you contact the
				platform directly.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Duration of data processing</h3>
			<p>
				We will inform you below about the duration of data processing, provided we have further information on this.
				For example, Amazon stores data until it is no longer needed for its own purposes. Generally, we only process
				your personal data as long as is absolutely necessary for the provision of our services and products.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Right to object</h3>
			<p>
				You also have the right and the opportunity to revoke your consent to the use of cookies at any time. This can
				be done either via our cookie management tool or via opt-out functions on the respective external platform. You
				can also prevent data collection through cookies by managing, deactivating or erasing the cookies in your
				browser.
			</p>
			<p>

				We use Vercel on our website, which is a cloud deployment platform. The provider of this service is the American
				company Vercel Inc., 340 S Lemon Ave #4133, Walnut, CA 91789.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vercel also processes data in the USA, among other countries. We would like to note, that according to the
				European Court of Justice, there is currently no adequate level of protection for data transfers to the USA.
				This can be associated with various risks to the legality and security of data processing.
			</p>
			<p>
				Vercel uses standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission as the basis for data processing by
				recipients based in third countries (i. e. outside the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and thus
				especially in the USA) or data transfer there (= Art. 46, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the GDPR). Standard Contractual
				Clauses (SCC) are legal templates provided by the EU Commission. Their purpose is to ensure that your data
				complies with European data privacy standards, even if your data is transferred to and stored in third countries
				(such as the USA). With these clauses, Vercel commits to comply with the EU‘s level of data protection when
				processing relevant data, even if it is stored, processed and managed in the USA. These clauses are based on an
				implementing order by the EU Commission. You can find the order and the standard contractual clauses here:{" "}

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What are video conferences &amp; streamings?</h3>
			<p>
				We use software programs that enable us to hold video conferences, online meetings, webinars and to utilise
				display sharing and/or streaming. In a video conference or a streaming, information is transmitted
				simultaneously via sound and moving images. With such video conference or streaming tools, we can communicate
				quickly and easily with customers, business partners, clients and employees via the Internet. Of course, when
				selecting the service provider, we consider the given legal framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				Generally, third-party providers can process data as soon as you interact with the software program. Third-party
				video conference providers or streaming solutions use your data and metadata for different purposes. The data
				helps to e.g. make the tool more secure and to improve the service. Most of the time, the data may also be used
				for the respective third-party provider&#8217;s own marketing purposes.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use video conferencing &amp; streaming on our website?</h3>
			<p>
				We want to communicate digitally, quickly, easily and securely with you, our customers and our business
				partners. This works best with video conferencing solutions that are very easy to use. Most tools also work
				directly in your browser and with just a few clicks you can get right to your video meeting. The tools also
				offer helpful additional features such as chat and screen sharing functions or the possibility of sharing
				content between meeting participants.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data are processed?</h3>
			<p>
				If you join our video conference or streaming, your data will also be processed and stored on the servers of the
				respective service provider.
			</p>
			<p>
				The exact data that gets stored depends on the respective software. Each provider stores and processes data
				differently. Generally, however, most providers store your name, address, contact details such as your email
				address or telephone number and your IP address. Information about the device you are using may also get stored,
				along with usage data, such as which websites you visit, when you visit a website or which buttons you click.
				Data that is shared within the video conference (photos, videos, texts) may also be retained.

				You always have the right to information, rectification and erasure of your personal data. If you have any

			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">What is an online booking system?</h3>
			<p>
				We use one or more booking systems which enable you to make bookings via our website. That way e.g. appointments
				can easily be created online. A booking system is a software application integrated into our website that
				displays available resources (such as available appointments) and allows you to book &#8211; and usually, also
				pay &#8211; directly online. You&#8217;ve probably already come across many such booking systems from the
				restaurant or hotel industry. However, such systems are actually used in a wide variety of industries. Depending
				on the tool and settings, booking systems can be used both by us internally, as well as by customers like
				yourself. In most cases, your personal data is also collected and stored.
			</p>
			<p>
				Bookings usually work as follows: You will find a booking system on our website, through which you can book an
				appointment directly with one click. Then you will enter your data and usually also be able to pay immediately.
				You may also have the option to enter various information about yourself into a form. Please be aware that any
				information you enter may be stored and managed in a database.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Why do we use an online booking system?</h3>
			<p>
				In a way, we also consider our website a free service for you. We want you to receive helpful information on our
				site and feel comfortable on there. This also includes an online service that makes it as easy as possible for
				you to book appointments or services. Gone are the days when you had to wait days for booking confirmations via
				phone or email. With an online booking system, you can get everything done after just a few clicks and get on
				with your day. The system also makes it easier for us to manage all bookings and appointments. Therefore, we
				consider a booking system absolutely sensible for both you and ourselves.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Which data is processed?</h3>
			<p>
				In this general introduction about booking systems, we naturally cannot tell you exactly what data is processed
				for which system. It always depends on the tool used, as well as the functions and possibilities it contains.
				What is more, in addition to the conventional booking function, many booking systems also offer a range of other
				features. For example, many systems also have an external online payment system (e.g. Stripe, Klarna or Paypal)
				and an integrated calendar synchronisation function. Accordingly, different data and different amounts of data
				can be processed, depending on the included functions. Usually, data such as your IP address, name and contact
				details, technical device information and the time of your booking are processed. If you also make a payment via
				the system, your bank details such as your account number, credit card number, passwords, TANs etc. will also be
				stored and passed on to the respective payment provider. We recommend you carefully read the respective privacy
				policy of the tool used, so that you know which of your data is processed specifically.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Duration of data processing</h3>
			<p>
				Each booking system stores data for different lengths of time. Therefore, we cannot yet give any specific
				information about the duration of data processing in this instance. In general, however, personal data is only
				stored for as long as is absolutely necessary to provide the services. Booking systems usually also use cookies,
				which store information for different lengths of time. While some cookies are erased immediately after leaving
				the site, others can be stored for a number of years. You can find out more about this in our “Cookies” section.
				Please also take a look at the respective privacy policies of the providers. There you should find answers on
				how long your data will be stored specifically.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Right to object</h3>
			<p>
				If you have consented to data processing by a booking system, you always retain the option and the right to
				revoke this consent. So please, always be aware that you have rights in relation to your personal data and that
				you can exercise these rights at any time. Thus, if you do not agree to the processing of your personal data,
				then none of your personal data may be processed. It is that simple. The easiest way to revoke data processing
				is via a cookie consent tool or via other available opt-out functions. You can, for example, manage data
				retention by cookies directly in your browser. Until you withdraw your consent, the lawfulness of data
				processing remains unaffected.
			</p>
			<h3 className="adsimple-112279866">Legal Basis</h3>
			<p>
				If you have agreed that booking systems may be used, this consent is the legal basis for the corresponding data
				processing. According to Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR (consent), your consent represents the legal basis for the
				processing of personal data, as it may occur through the use of booking systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Furthermore, we also have a legitimate interest in using booking systems because we use them to extend our
				customer service and to optimise our internal booking organisation. The corresponding legal basis for this is
				Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interests). However, we strongly want to emphasise once more that we only use
				these tools if you have given your consent.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can find information on different booking systems &#8211; if available &#8211; in the following sections.

				We always strive to make our privacy policy as clear and comprehensible as possible. However, this is not always

				Profiling

			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Definition according to Article 4 of the GDPR</strong>
			</p>
			<p>For the purposes of this Regulation, the term means:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<em>
						<strong className="adsimple-112279866">&#8220;Profiling&#8221;</strong> means any form of automated
						processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects
						relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural
						person&#8217;s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests,
						reliability, behaviour, location or movements;
					</em>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				<strong className="adsimple-112279866">Explanation:</strong> Profiling collects various personal data about an
				individual in order to learn more about that individual. On the internet, profiling is often used for
				advertising purposes or for credit checks. Web and advertising analysis programs e. g. collect data about your
				behaviour and interests on a website. This results in a special user profile that can be used to target
				advertising to specific target groups.
